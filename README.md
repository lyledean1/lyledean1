ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently at Kaluza, where I am a tech lead working to make the grid more sustainable and flexible to help fight climate change. This includes a frontend mobile app in Flutter and backend in Golang with Kafka.

ðŸŒ± I am currently expanding my knowledge on compilers, languages and also learning the Rust programming language.

Some of the things I've done over the last year in my spare time:

[GPTshell is a tool for developers to query and interact with ChatGPT's language capabilities through an interactive shell](https://github.com/lyledean1/gptshell)

[Calculon Language Built In Rust Using LLVM and LALRPOP](https://github.com/lyledean1/calculon)

[Add "Not Equal Operator" to the CPython Compiler](https://github.com/lyledean1/cpython/pull/1)

[Implemented the Lox Language in C According to "Crafting Interpreters" Book](https://github.com/lyledean1/lox)

[Reverse Engineer a Whoop Band and Build A Simple UI in Swift](https://github.com/lyledean1/blescanner)
